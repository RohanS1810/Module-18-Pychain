# Module-18-Pychain

## I was able to run my streamlit tests on Windows but encountered an error on my mac, some sort of privacy/permission error, I searched through Streamlit's help and documentation and couldn't get that sorted out. When I runned it on my windows however, it did work, It displayed a "pychain ledger" as well as the "block inspector". I just can't get it to work on my mac.
